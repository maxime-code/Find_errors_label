# Label Error Detection with AI

This project aims to detect label errors in datasets using artificial intelligence. Specifically, we compare the predictions from a Detectron2 model with the ground truth annotations from the BDD100K dataset to identify annotation errors.


## Introduction

Label errors can significantly affect the performance of machine learning models. This project uses Detectron2, a deep learning library for object detection, to compare model predictions with the annotations from the BDD100K dataset. This allows us to identify and correct label errors, improving the dataset's quality.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- Detectron2
- BDD100K Dataset
